# Hidden_Picture
Java game in which player clicks on black screen that slowly uncovers an image, allowing them to predict what's behind

Project split into three classes: RandomImage.java, RectangleCover.java, scratchImage.java

1) RandomImage.java selected a random image from a list to show behind the black screen

2) RectangleCover.java uses a double for loop to cover screen with black squares

3) scratchImage.java, driver class for the program, causes each black square to remove once clicked on

Coded as the final project for my 9th grade Alice and Java course
